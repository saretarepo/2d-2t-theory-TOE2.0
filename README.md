Two-Time Physics (2D-2T): A Correlated Temporal Framework Resolving Fundamental
Paradoxes.
Abstract
We present a rigorous examination of two-time physics (2D-2T) — a theoretical framework
incorporating two temporal dimensions (t₁, t₂) with intrinsic correlation — as a resolution to
long-standing problems in conventional 3D-1T physics. This approach naturally addresses:
- Singularity avoidance in black holes and cosmology
- Non-fine-tuned inflationary dynamics
- Quantum nonlocality
- Dark matter as an emergent temporal phenomenon
Critically, we demonstrate why quantum gravity proves renormalizable exclusively in 2D-2T
due to temporal correlation constraints, while remaining intractable in 3D-1T formulations.
